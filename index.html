    <h2>SECTION ONE</h2>
    <P>Mountains are really very beautiful and refreshing landscape to look at. Speaking in the geographical terms, mountains are highly elevated part of land.

        They attain greater height as compared to surrounding land. Mountains are one of the most prominent feature of the Earth’s landscape.
        
        They symbolize perfection, success, strength and many other positive traits. The highest tip of the mountain is called it’s ‘Peak’.
        
        Although there are other elevated land forms also like, Plateau, Cliff, Hills etc. but the height of mountain is greatest of all. The height of the mountain is calculated on the basis of mean sea level on Earth.  
        
        Although there is no commonly agreed average height, above which an elevation can be considered a mountain. But in general terms, an elevation above 1,000 meters from the mean sea level can be considered as a mountain.  
        
        When there are several mountain in continuation, they form a ‘Mountain Chain’. And when these Mountain Chains run parallel to each other, they are called a ‘Mountain Range’.
        
        Being at the great heights, most of the mountains are covered with the thick layer of snow throughout the year. And this scenic & serene natural beauty provides good opportunity of recreation also, to the tourists.  
        
        Mountains generally have a broader base, while their top are narrower. At different altitudes of a mountain, different types floral & faunal species are found. Alpine and Coniferous forests are found at the mountains.  
        
        Mountains add up tremendous beauty to the surrounding landscape, as the great Himalayas does to the north Indian landscape of our country. And the Alps does to the European landscape.

        <h2>SECTION TWO</h2>
        <P>Mountains, majestic and awe-inspiring, are not just natural formations but a testament to the dynamic processes of our planet. They are geological wonders, sculpted over millions of years by tectonic forces, erosion, and glaciation. These towering structures serve as the world’s water towers, biodiversity hotspots, and are central to numerous cultures and traditions.

            Formation of Mountains
            Mountains are primarily formed through tectonic forces, when the Earth’s crust is subjected to immense pressure. This pressure, arising from the movement of tectonic plates, causes the crust to buckle, fold, or fracture, giving rise to mountain ranges. The most prominent example of such a process is the formation of the Himalayas, resulting from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
            
            Ecological Significance
            Mountains are biodiversity hotspots, fostering a diverse range of flora and fauna. The variation in altitude, climate, and isolation creates unique habitats, leading to high levels of endemism. Mountains also play a crucial role in the water cycle. They intercept air masses, causing them to cool and condense, resulting in precipitation. This process ensures the replenishment of river systems and groundwater reserves, making mountains the ‘water towers’ of the world.

        <h2>SECTION THREE</h2>
        <P>
            When the moisture laden winds hit the giant mountains they cause the rainfall, which is called ‘OROGRAPHIC RAINFALL’.

            Although these rains occur only at one side of the mountain called ‘Windward side’, while the other side called ‘Leeward side’ remains deficient of it.
            
            And this gradually turns the region in Leeward side into a desert.
            
            For example, the region in the east of Aravalli Mountains gets sufficient precipitation, while the region to its west has gradually got converted into the Great Indian Desert called Thar Desert.   
            
            They define the course of winds
            Quite similar to above phenomena, the great height of mountains causes the winds to change their course, which improves air circulation and define the temperature of a region.
            
            Like the strong cold winds from Siberia are interrupted by the great Himalayas. This keeps temperature of our country moderate. And saves northern India from shivering cold.
